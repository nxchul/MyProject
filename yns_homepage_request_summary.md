# YNS Homepage Request Summary

## Investigation Results

After thoroughly exploring the workspace to understand what was requested for the YNS homepage, I found the following:

### Current Branch
- **Branch Name**: `cursor/show-requested-elements-for-yns-homepage-3b11`
- **Implication**: The branch name suggests work was requested for showing requested elements for a YNS homepage

### Actual Repository Content
The repository contains **no YNS homepage-related files or content**. Instead, it contains:

1. **Golf Putting Assistant Arduino Code** (`golf_putting_assistant.ino`)
   - 383 lines of Arduino code
   - IMU sensor integration (QMI8658)
   - WiFi web server for configuration
   - LED indicators for putting alignment
   - Calibration functionality

2. **Golf Putting Analysis Documents** (in Korean)
   - `golf_putting_aim_calculation.md` - Detailed physics calculations for golf putting aim
   - `golf_putting_physics_analysis.md` - Analysis of projectile motion on inclined surfaces

3. **Basic Project Files**
   - `README.md` - Minimal content
   - `test.txt` - Empty file

### Git History
- **Recent Commits**: All focused on golf putting calculations and Arduino development
- **Pull Requests**: 
  - PR #1: "Calculate maximum height of golf putt"
  - PR #2: "Summarize previous discussions" (which added the Arduino code)

## Conclusion

**No YNS homepage content was found in the repository.** The branch name suggests that a YNS homepage was requested, but the actual development work was focused entirely on golf putting analysis and Arduino sensor integration.

## Possible Explanations

1. **Mismatch**: The branch name may not accurately reflect the actual work performed
2. **Incomplete Work**: The YNS homepage work may have been requested but not yet implemented
3. **Context Switch**: The focus may have shifted from YNS homepage to golf putting analysis

## Recommendations

To clarify what was actually requested for the YNS homepage:
1. Check with the original requester for specific requirements
2. Review any external documentation or specifications
3. Determine if the golf putting work was intended or if YNS homepage work is still needed
